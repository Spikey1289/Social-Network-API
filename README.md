# Social-Network-API

## Introduction
This is the README for the Social Network API challenge of my coding bootcamp. This Repository contains the files for a noSQL database and its accompanying APIs. These APIs allow users to create accounts (in a limited capacity, no password), make 'thoughts' that are connected to their account, and add reactions to thoughts, as well as 'friend' other users.

## Things Learned
During this Challenge, I learned a lot about non-sequel databases. I created a database in mongodb, and made the routes for CRUD operations. I used mongoose and mongodb to create and test this database, along with insomnia to test the API routes. These were somewhat unfamiliar to me because the underlying database was so different from what I was used to (MySQL).
